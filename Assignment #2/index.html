					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

					Every weekend in Bangkok (THAILAND) this large night market takes place outside of the world mall. From the fourth floor of the mall parking garage, we were able to get a stunning vantage point of the market below. We could even feel the spices as we breathed in the air from above.

						This is my all time favorite star trail shot Iâ€™ve ever done. While on vacation in Lake Powell, the moon was out so I had very little chance of catching the Milky Way. However, this came with something even better, while shooting my evening stars the moon lit up the cliff sides making for some amazing shots.
